# NextCodeWorks

Welcome to my portfolio website, where **performance** and **simplicity** come first. No frameworks. No dependencies. Just **pure code** for **lightning-fast websites** that deliver without the framework bloat.

## Project Overview
NextCodeWorks is a **vanilla** tech stack website (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), built with **performance** and **user experience** as the top priority. **No dynamic loading** slowing you down. **No unnecessary complexity**. Just simple, clean, and responsive code that works.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **HTML5** ‚Äì Structure, simplicity, and a bit of magic.  
- **CSS3** ‚Äì Styling that‚Äôs responsive and fluid.  
- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Interactivity without the **heavier frameworks** (because who needs 'em?).  

## üåê Features
- **Lightning-fast load times**: Who needs a 5-second wait?  
- **Fully responsive**: Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop without the hassle of dynamic loading bugs.  
- **No bloated frameworks**: Everything you need, nothing you don‚Äôt.  

## üí° Why Vanilla?
In a world of bloated, over-engineered websites, **we‚Äôre keeping it real**. This project is proof that you don‚Äôt need **JavaScript frameworks**, **dynamic rendering**, or **ridiculous dependencies** to make a functional, responsive, and lightning-fast **static** website. It's all about **simplicity, speed**, and **clean code**. (next.js is hard to setup on GH Pages)
