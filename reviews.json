The developer went above and beyond when it comes to getting the bot done and I am pretty sure they're capable of making anything that you're looking for at the right price. I am not here to slander or give less than 5 stars knowing that they did their best, communicated very well and stayed real from start to end when it comes to making the bot along with the effort they put into it. They are also very friendly while remaining professional. I generally would not want to post a rating cause that means in the long run they become more desired by other buyers. Though in their favor I want them to succeed and do well so all I can do is give my gratitude for wanting to help me with my projects.",

I would not hesitate to work with Devon again and strongly recommend him."
