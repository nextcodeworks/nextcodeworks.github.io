I am not here to slander or give less than 5 stars knowing that they did their best, communicated very well and stayed real from start to end when it comes to making the bot along with the effort they put into it. They are also very friendly while remaining professional. I generally would not want to post a rating cause that means in the long run they become more desired by other buyers.
